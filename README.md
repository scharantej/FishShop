Certainly! Let's design a Flask application for a webpage selling fresh or frozen fish to restaurants.

## HTML Files

### 1. **index.html**
   - Homepage of the website, providing information about the business, fish species, and contact information. It includes a navigation bar for exploring different pages.

### 2. **products.html**
   - Displays the available fish species, their prices, and descriptions. Features a search bar for filtering products and an "Add to Cart" button for each fish.

### 3. **cart.html**
   - Lists the fish items that have been added to the cart during the purchase process. Contains options to remove items, update quantities, and view the total bill.

### 4. **checkout.html**
   - Checkout page where the customer fills in their shipping and payment information. It displays the order summary and allows users to confirm their purchase.

### 5. **order_confirmation.html**
   - Confirmation page shown after successful purchase. Displays the order details and provides a tracking number.

## Routes

### 1. **Home Route** (`@app.route('/')`)
   - Displays the homepage ('index.html').
